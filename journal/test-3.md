Gridsome + Forestry

It's actually fairly easy (unless you don't have a clue how GitHub and CMSs work).

You just need to go the [README of the repo](https://github.com/Berkmann18/gridsome-forestry-starter "README of this repo") and click the "Import to Forestry" button and go on from there.

Enjoy!!
